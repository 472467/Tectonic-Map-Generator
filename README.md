The Tectonic Map Generator is a project I created many years ago as one of my erearly forays into test-driven deveopment.

It was the culmination of a series of projects in various programming languages I have made over the years to produce realistic looking world maps with plausible mountains, coasts and rivers.

It supports [cylindrical](https://github.com/marchamann/Tectonic-Map-Generator/tree/master/cylindrical.png),  [sinusoidal](https://github.com/marchamann/Tectonic-Map-Generator/tree/master/sinusoidal.png) and  [sinusoidal separated](https://github.com/marchamann/Tectonic-Map-Generator/tree/master/sinusoidalseparated.png) projections.
